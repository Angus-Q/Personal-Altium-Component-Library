# Personal-Altium-Component-Library
This is my personal component library for Altium Designer. This component library contains a small range of parts that I commonly use within my designs. I have not tested all of the components yet, so be aware that there might be mistakes within the library.

## Installation
Full instructions for installing this library on your local machine as a file-based library can be found on my website under the technical documentation section, or at the following URL:

## TODO:

- Create generic parts with common sizes instead of adding supplier links to parts. This makes parts more 'symbolic' and 'generalised'
- Add supplier links to parts that only need them, like IC's.
