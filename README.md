# Personal-Altium-Component-Library
This is my personal component library for Altium Designer. This component library contains a small range of parts that I commonly use within my designs. I have not tested all of the components yet, so be aware that there might be mistakes within the library.

## TODO:

- Add installation instructions for this lib, for both Altium Workspace and offline use.
